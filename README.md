# Silicon Valley
A mod for a Steam Early Access game called [Startup Company](https://startupcompany.com), adding bits an pieces of the popular HBO comedy series [Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988) in to it.

## Installation
The best way to install mods is through the Steam Workshop as updates are performed automatically for you.
If you want to run this code on the game and tinker around with it: see [this article](https://github.com/hovgaardgames/startupcompany/wiki/Modding#install-mods) and clone the repo to the right location on your machine.

## About Startup Company
Startup Company is developed by one guy, [Jonas Hovgaard](https://github.com/hovgaardgames), in his spare time and he documents his endeavor for everybody to see on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jhovgaard). As the game is built with tools like Electron and Angular (ie. practically only HTML, (Node)JS and CSS), it's quite easy to [start modding](https://github.com/hovgaardgames/startupcompany/wiki/Modding) the game.

# About the mod and future plans
For now, only employees are transformed to one of the main characters if the conditions are right and luck is in your favor. I'm also planning to add the companies featured in the series as your competitors and add some featured products as well.

This is my first try at a mod for this game and you'll find the code is riddled with comments and tools to get started and to understand the workings of the game. So use this to your advantage, should you be inclined to start modding for Startup Company as well.

If you have any questions or critiques about this mod, you can create a new issue here or find me on [Discord at Hovgaard Games](https://discord.gg/hovgaardgames#modding).
